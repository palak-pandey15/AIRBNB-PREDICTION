# AIRBNB-PREDICTION
In this project we have to predict price of the AIRBNB  rentals based on various features of the properties listed on the platform.
Airbnb Inc is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. Airbnb has close to 150 million customers across the world. Price is the most important factor considered by the customer while making booking into a property. Strategic pricing of the properties is important to avoid losing customers to the competitors.
We have a data of 74111 Airbnb properties across the nations. Based on this data build multiple linear regression model to predict the strategic pricing of a new listed property on Airbnb.
